                            Having worked with companies big and small, with waterfall or agile, process oriented or not, I can evaluate and adapt what would best leverage your company towards its goals.

                            I have been both a software development manager, a team leader and a software developer so you can expect me to understand and mix well their mindsets, needs and expectations in order to accomplish their best results possible.

                        <p>
                            DataEasy believed in me to be their Software Development Manager and I'm happy to have boosted their software quality, development process and the overall culture of the company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started bringing a mixture of agile methodologies (Scrum, XP, Kanban) to the team (12 people) and accumulating some functions of Scrum Master, Product Owner, Tech Leader, DevOps Leader and meeting Driver. Within time, after some training and better knowing each team member, I started delegating this functions and focusing on other managerial tasks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have brought "one-on-one" meetings where I could, every other week, closely follow each team member development and satisfaction as well align theirs goals with the company's and exchange feedback. This personal and constant interaction keeps me grounded and real on my plans for the team, as gives me confidence to carry on based on the positive feedbacks or an early opportunity to adapt and shift directions otherwise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I could introduce DataEasy to a more collaborative and innovative and relaxed culture by establishing "Research &amp; Development" day: a day where it would be free from the day-to-day work to search for new solutions, new technologies, invest time in side projects... Anything that would potentially add value to the company, our product, our environment or our customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team was also happy with the sporadic Talks I started motivating and facilitating amongst them. Whenever someone would learn a new technology or anything worth sharing, they could schedule a mini-talk (a "brown bag session") for the whole tech team and share the knowledge away.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the technical side, I happily shook their grounds: introduced SemVer to our convetions; migrated all codebases - super big (1 GB) or small - to Git; adopted Bitbucket (and then GitHub); introduced Slack as the offical company communication tool; Google Apps for Business; the great New Relic for monitoring our servers and applications; introduced Maven, Unit Tests and Continuous Integration to team, rocketing the team's and product's quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far, I'm focusing on bettering the development processes through BPM. I've mapped our AS-IS processes and am now working on the MUST-BE and later on the SHOULD-BE versions.

                            Brandwatch had a great agile environment and an even greater team: with a strongly test and code review oriented process, we had an enforced culture towards performance, clean code and in-depth Javascript writing.

                            I'm grateful for Content Fleet taking me all the way from Brazil to Germany. I was able to repay the investment with hard work, features shipped in record time and some innovations do their development process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After 4 months I was granted the position of Frontend Team Leader and Senior Developer. From then on architectural decisions, major refactorings and team coaching were my responsibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also improved the deploy process by entirely automating it via shell script. The script consisted in concatenating, minifying, versioning all the resources for fine-grained user-cache control and publish to our servers.

                    All work experience from 2004 to 2011 was obtained alongside under-graduation (professional     activities at day-time and classes during night-time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this period I have also developed over 12 applications and websites as a freelancer programmer, mainly in PHP, CSS and MySQL.

                        <p>
                            Before finishing college I was able to pass in a highly competitive contest that granted me a place in the public service of my state. In there I was responsible for refactoring and implementing the business rules for the Human Resource system that run for the entire state.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During this period I was able to become a Certified Java Programmer. But after I graduated I felt the need to learn and challenge myself more, so I decided to abdicate of my public service seat in order to seek self-realization.

                            Being an AIESEC member is a truly unique experience. I spent one year in each team in this great organization where I could expand my horizons and meet exciting people from all over the world.
