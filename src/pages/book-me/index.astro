          <q class="text-gray-600 italic mb-4 block">Luiz have offered me a personalized approach. He took the time to understand my background, skills, and career goals. He skillfully highlighted my achievements and skills while providing valuable feedback on structure and clarity. He encouraged my input and feedback throughout, making me feel like a valued partner in the resume improvement process. He efficiently delivered a polished resume within the promised timeframe, which was crucial for my job applications. In short, his personalized, detail-oriented, collaborative, and timely approach made my CV much much better.</q>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <q class="text-gray-600 italic mb-4 block">I recently completed a series of five mentorship sessions with Luiz and the experience has been transformative for my professional development. [...] After gradually incorporating his feedback on my methods I could say I am a better engineer now, more connected with the required mindset the tech industry demands when it comes to focusing on impact and providing business value. Proof of this is that while we were working together, I was immersed in multiple job interview processes and I ended up with two offers in my inbox. Implementing his advice made me get a raise of 10% in my salary and get additional perks not in the original offer.</q>
